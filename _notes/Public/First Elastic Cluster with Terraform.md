title : First Elastic Cluster with Terraform

For my day job with Elastic, I have had several customers deploying their clusters with Terraform. I have no experience using Terraform and so I thought it would be worth some investigation.

I started with [this post](https://www.elastic.co/blog/using-terraform-with-elastic-cloud) from the Elastic blog, which was an excellent starting point, but it didn't give much history on Terraform or an intro to it. It probably assumed people going there have some familairity with TF, which I don't ðŸ˜…. Indeed I didn't even have Terraform installed!

## Installing Terraform

I'm on a Mac, so I used brew to install Terraform following the [official docs](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads). Two commands and I had everything installed as needed:

```shell
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
```

Now that we've got everything installed I'm ready to create my first cluster with Terraform!

## Creating our first cluster

Below is the Terraform configuration file I started with `starter.tf`, I'm going to break down my current understand of what the blocks are and what they mean:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0.0"

  required_providers {
    ec = {
      source = "elastic/ec"
      version = "0.5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "ec" { }

resource "ec_deployment" "custom-deployment-id" {
  name = "My deployment identifier"
  
  region = "gcp-europe-west3"
  version = "8.1.3"
  deployment_template_id = "gcp-memory-optimized-v2"
  
  elasticsearch {}
  
  kibana {}
}
```

The first block, also known as the `terraform block` is used for configuring Terraform itself. The current version of TF (as of Nov 12th, 2022) is 1.3.4, which is what I installed.If you want to know the latest current version it is shown at the top of their [downloads page](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

In the `required_providers` block I specificy that I need the [Elastic Cloud provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/elastic/ec/latest/docs). There is a full list of providers available [here](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers). I am excited to play with some of the others!
