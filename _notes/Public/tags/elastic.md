I started working for Elastic in 2021, but I've been a user of Elasticsearch for a really long time. I've built applications on top of Elastic as well as used Elastic as an observability tool.

It's a pleasure to work for such a great company!

I am constantly surprised at how little I know about Elasticsearch and my customers teach me new things all the time. Most of the posts below are me trying to catch up to where a customer is and offering to take everyone along with me. Let me know if there is a question about Elastic I can help answer for you!
