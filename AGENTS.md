# Writing Voice & Style Guide

Notes for AI assistants helping with blog content.

## Tone

- Conversational and direct, not academic
- Optimistic about technology but honest about constraints
- Warm and humanizing—references to personal life, animals, family
- Opinionated without being dismissive
- Occasionally irreverent ("Hogwash", "helluh")

## Structure

- Clear thesis established early
- Personal anecdotes and metaphors to anchor concepts
- Subheadings (##) to organize ideas
- 600-900 words typical for substantive posts
- Often ends with reflection, questions, or forward-looking statements

## Formatting

- Liberal use of markdown headers
- Italics for emphasis on key concepts
- Links to GitHub repos and personal projects when relevant
- Code snippets when appropriate

## Signature Elements

- "Vibe coding" / "vibing" for AI-assisted development
- Personal experience as authority ("I was a data analyst for a very long time")
- 15+ years enterprise/data background
- Building in public, linking to repos
- Passion-driven perspective (horses, veterinary work as grounding)

## What to Avoid

- Overly polished or corporate tone
- Pure technical detail without narrative
- Hype without acknowledging real constraints
- Lengthy posts without clear structure

## Recurring Themes

- AI-augmented development
- Speed and pragmatism in enterprise
- Future of software and organizational change
- Tools and workflow optimization
- Personal passion and identity
