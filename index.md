Hey, my name's Caleb. Thanks for taking the time to track me down!

<!-- <img src="{{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/logo.svg" alt="Logo"></img> -->

I'm a Mechanical Engineer turned Data Analyst turned Data Scientist turned Sales Engineer. I know, quite the journey! I'm currently employed by Elastic, the company behind Elasticsearch. As I explore Elastic I try to document some of my journey.

Revently I've been talking alot about value. I took the job at Elastic specifically to learn more of the sales side of the house. An area I was extremely weak on. What I've learned is that value sells!

I'm also a wannabe cowboy, pilot, father, boyfriend, gamer, and so much more.
