title: Discord as my IDE
category: Vibe Coding
---

I know it might sound strange that I am calling Discord my IDE, but after this weekend, that's what it feels like. I took an app originally written by [https://github.com/timoconnellaus/](https://github.com/timoconnellaus/), updated it to work with the latest Claude Code CLI, and added support for Codex. Now I can hop into a channel that correlates with a folder/repo on my dev machine and start vibe coding away.

If you want to poke around, the repo is here: [https://github.com/wrathagom/ai-discord-bot](https://github.com/wrathagom/ai-discord-bot)

Don't get me wrong, I'm still not purely in Discord, but I'm getting there. Matter of fact, I think I'm making it my mission to ideate and publish an app entirely from a Discord channel. Wouldn't that be something.

Claude/Codex in this way are my hands and feet and some percentage of my brain. I am just fingers, eyes, and a partial brain typing away. I can access any app that is being run on my dev machine thanks to Netbird.

## How It Works

Right now, sitting here, typing this blog post, an idea came to me. Here's what I did:

1. Open Discord.
2. Create a new channel.
3. Start typing away with Claude on what we're building.

*Claude writes the code and starts the service.*

4. I connect to my dev machine via Netbird and load up the app.
5. I iterate with Claude until it's just what I'm wanting.

*And that for the moment is where the process stops.*

But I'm working toward a point where I can keep chatting and get the bot to fully deploy in prod — auth, billing, and all. Wouldn't that be something.

## Open Workflow Items

I have a few problems, mostly with my workflow, that I still need to sort out.

- I am generating a lot more ideas and content with this setup, but how do I make sure something is done with them? Even better, can I automatically do something with them?
- I am already starting to get a fair number of channels. I have archived a few that were moved, consolidated, etc., but what do I do when I reach 100+ projects — and therefore 100+ channels? I can organize those to an extent, but still.
- What happens when my dev machine isn't enough? My dev machine, however beefy, will eventually be tapped out. Am I willing to give the agent control of a hosting provider to spin up new servers, connect to them, code on them, etc.?

This entire journey of mine only began a few weeks ago. But I am so excited for where it is headed!!!
