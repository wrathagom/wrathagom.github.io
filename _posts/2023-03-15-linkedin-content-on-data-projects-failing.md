Here I go again, turning one idea into multiple pieces of content following Justin Welsh's concept. I like typing these out long form here first and then cutting it up into individual LinkedIn and Twitter posts.

Here's the idea:

> Data Projects will fail without being value driven

And here are Justin Welsh's 7 things to turn it into:

 - A story

Once upon a time, there was an eager data team

They used the latest tech, built with big data, and leveraged AI

### A Listicle

Value can be useful tool for understanding the failure.

Here are 5 ways projects fail and what that means for their value:

 - A Project can fail if it takes too long
