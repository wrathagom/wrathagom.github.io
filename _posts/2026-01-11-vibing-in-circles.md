In certain ways the current state of AI feels liberating. I've always fared better when I can work on what I want, when my mind wants to work on that thing. Vibing with Claude and now Codex lets me move from one task to another. The context switching cost has gone down because my AI partner holds onto their context. For people with minds like mine, you understand that sometimes *not* switching tasks when your mind wants to has a much higher cost than switching.

But the flip side is that it's one more tool to get distracted with. It allows me to be a producer with no outputs. I can spend hours spinning up the beginning of the next best idea, never finishing the last one.

I want it to be a tool that changes my life—lets me be more productive, more successful. But what if it just steals all my time away in the name of "moving faster"?

In the content creation world, it used to be a big thing to talk about being a creator, not a consumer. The reference being all the lurkers who scroll and scroll and scroll social media without ever trying to say something of their own. Used that way, social media becomes an anchor that holds you back.

There's a strong similarity with AI happening right now. You can spend all day prompting, iterating, exploring—and feel like you're being productive because you're *doing* something. But are you shipping? Are you finishing? Or are you just vibing in circles?

I don't have the answer yet. I'm watching myself closely. The potential is real, but so is the trap.
