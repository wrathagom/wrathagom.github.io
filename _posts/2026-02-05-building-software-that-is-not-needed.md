title: "Building Software That Isn't Needed"
category: Vibe Coding

I wrote a couple of days ago about my [cd-info tool]({% post_url 2026-02-03-cd-info-for-multi-taskers %}) that I had vibe-coded into existence. It's a simple bash script that displays info of your choosing when you `cd` into a particular directory. Simple, valuable, perfect... right?

I've already previously written about my experimentation with [moving my entire dev workflow into Discord]({% post_url 2026-01-13-discord-as-my-ide %}), which I am still working on. I just enjoy the terminal so much at times. Well here's the thing, if I genuinely moved my workflow into Discord, I wouldn't ever be `cd`ing into a directory... I built a small piece of software that I am actively trying to eliminate the need for.

I feel like all evolutions of software, data tools, etc have gone through this sort of evolution. I remember building dashboards to inform user decisions only to immediately automate the actions the user was taking once they looked at the dashboard.

So is it a problem or not to be building things you know will likely be replaced very soon?

No, it's not. Especially if the time to build them was very minimal. It might actually lead into the next thing or the next thing.

I'm going to keep building tools that help me today, while also trying to imagine and implement the things that will help me tomorrow. That is software development at its core. Build for today. Replace it tomorrow.

Have you ever noticed you were writing code you planned to obsolete soon?
