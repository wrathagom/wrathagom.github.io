title: I Am a Cyborg Now

I am officially an *augmented* dev and data engineer. I've been vibe coding with Claude for several weeks now. I'm building several different apps simultaneously—some have hardware components, most are pure software. Today I started mixing in Codex.

I've gotten a [Discord bot]({% post_url 2026-01-13-discord-as-my-ide %}) (someone else wrote the original) up and running, then tweaked it to do a bunch more things. Now I can vibe code from my phone no matter where I am. I can drop it a command and it will create and spin up an app that I can test remotely thanks to Netbird. My end goal is to go from idea to product fully within a Discord channel. And I'm not just dreaming—it's actually working.

I still can't believe how fast things have changed and are still changing. We're in the industrial revolution of software. It's going to become a commodity, cheap enough that anyone can make it. The barrier to entry is collapsing in real time.

I'm starting to think through what this means. For my life. My career. But also for the world at large. What happens to app stores when spinning up an app takes minutes instead of months? What happens to APIs when anyone can build their own integrations on the fly? What happens to the concept of "buying software" when creating it becomes trivial? I don't have answers yet, but the questions themselves are wild. (I explore some of these ideas in [The End of Software As We Know It]({% post_url 2026-01-15-end-of-software-as-we-know-it %}).)

I'm so excited to be alive at this exact moment. I just hope robotics makes as much progress—if it does, I could see some truly incredible things in my remaining years. Software eating the world was one thing. Software *and* hardware eating the world together? That's something else entirely.

I'll explore more of these topics in future posts. I'll probably also go back and talk about more of my history—how I got here, what I was building before, what the journey looked like.

But for now, suffice it to say: I am a cyborg.
