title: Vibing With Generative Art
category: Vibe Coding
---

I had these Jupyter Notebooks where I was playing around with generative art. They were fun and pushed my programming skills as I learned how to do very abstract things iteratively and performatively. I recently started vibe coding the same types of things and wanted to share where that project is at the current moment. If you want to check out the original Jupyter Notebooks, they're located [here](https://github.com/wrathagom/exploring-generative-art) but that repo has been archived as I move to working on [this one](https://github.com/wrathagom/generative-art). And all of this is hosted on GitHub Pages and can be accessed live [here](https://calebmkeller.com/generative-art).

Here are some of the currently supported art styles:

## Chaotic Lines

This one is pure organized chaos. Horizontal lines with random wiggles, stacked on top of each other, each in a different color from the palette. It reminds me of DNA sequences or some kind of abstract data visualization. Every refresh gives you something new.

## Diagonal Lines

A maze-like pattern of black and white diagonal lines with a purple noise overlay. It creates this almost optical illusion effect where your eyes want to find a path through. I love how something so simple — just diagonal lines — can create such visual complexity.

## Joy Division

Inspired by the iconic Unknown Pleasures album cover, but I cranked up the color. Stacked waveforms that look like topographic maps or audio visualizations. The original was stark white on black. Mine is a party.

## Bubbles

Overlapping circles of various sizes scattered across a dark canvas. Some are solid, some have that crescent moon effect where they overlap. It's simple but mesmerizing — kind of like watching a lava lamp.

## Code Rain

The Matrix called, it wants its aesthetic back. Green characters falling down the screen in columns at different speeds. This one is animated, so it really comes alive on the live site. A classic for a reason.

## What's Next?

I'm not sure where this project goes from here. Maybe more art styles, maybe customization options, maybe something entirely different. That's the beauty of [vibe coding]({% post_url 2026-01-10-i-am-a-cyborg-now %}) — I don't have to know. I just have to keep vibing.

If you have ideas for new styles or want to contribute, the repo is open. Or just play around with it at [calebmkeller.com/generative-art](https://calebmkeller.com/generative-art) and see what you get.
