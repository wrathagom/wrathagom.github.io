I've always been fascinated with life calendars. So I decided to vibe-code my own, because why not. Here's where I'm at in my current life, almost dead center, thankfully not just plain dead.

It's pure JavaScript and just runs on GitHub Pages. Fun note: once you have a custom domain configured on `wrathagom.github.io`, other repos with GitHub Pages enabled will automatically show up at `https://wrathagom.github.io/{repo-name}`. In this case, the repo is located at [https://github.com/wrathagom/life-calendar](https://github.com/wrathagom/life-calendar), while the life calendar itself is running at:

> [http://calebmkeller.com/life-calendar/](http://calebmkeller.com/life-calendar/)

Give it a go!

I didn't create the concept of life calendars, and I'm certainly not the first to codify it. But I just wanted to own it, so I could control it. I built it for me, as a reminder to me. But I'm hopeful someone else may benefit.

## Features

Features so far include several developer-oriented themes — Gruvbox, anyone? — and the ability to add highlights. If you know me and my story, then you know that there have been periods of my life that defined the others. Highlights were my way of reminding myself of the significance or insignificance of different time periods. 10 months... barely a drop. 12 years? Yeah that one hurt.

## Future

Where am I going to take it? Well, I don't really know, but you can bet I'm going to vibe code it in my [Discord bot](https://github.com/wrathagom/ai-discord-bot)! Have any suggestions? Feel free to create an issue on the repo, or reach out on one of my socials.
