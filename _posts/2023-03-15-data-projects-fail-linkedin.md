Here I go again, turning one idea into multiple pieces of content following Justin Welsh's concept.

Here's the idea:

> Data Projects will fail without being value driven

And here are Justin Welsh's 7 things to turn it into:

 - A story 
 - A listicle 
 - A teardown 
 - An observation 
 - Contrarian take 
 - Past vs. present 
 - A future prediction 

Let's go!
