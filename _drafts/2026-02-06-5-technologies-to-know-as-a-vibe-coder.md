title: "5 Technologies To Know As A Vibe Coder"
category: Vibe Coding

I talked in my last post about how I am NOT a software engineer. The fanciest title I can claim is likely Data Scientist or Data Engineer. But I don't have a Computer Science degree or 30 years writing code. What I do have is 15 years building solutions that drove business value. And to that end I learned and figured a lot of things out along the way through pain and failures.

I can call myself a vibe coder now. It fits my style. I can direct AI plenty well to build code that works, is fully tested, is isolated, and is maintainable. But I feel like I share roots with newer vibe-coders: ones coming from the business. After all I am "just" a mechanical engineer.

To that end, here are 5 technologies or tools that busines born vibe-coders need to know about, complete with sample prompts of how to bring them in to your project:

## Git

## Environment Variables

## Virtual Environments

## Docker

## Testing
