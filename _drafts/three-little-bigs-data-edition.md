Once upon a time there was a company with a brand new data team, and as the company wanted AI, it sent them out to seek a path forward.

The three new employees decided to build a data product, and set off to find the most valuable solution.

But soon they came across a Man selling a business intelligence solution.

The first new employee said to himself:

“Now I won’t need to do so much up front work! I don't need pipelines, processes, or a proper understanding. This BI tool will allow me to use my SQL hammer to build dashboards to anser all of the companies needs. I’d much rather do quicker work, and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing.”

So the first employee said to the Man seeling the BI solution:

“Please, Man, sell me that product so that I can build my solution out of it.”

The Man did, and the employee quickly built a thousand dashboards with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon.

Presently came along a Wolf, and knocked at the door, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”

To which the Pig answered, “No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in!” said the Wolf.

So he huffed and he puffed, and he blew his house in. Alas! because the house had not been very well made, it fell down, and the wolf was able to eat the little Pig up in an instant.

Meanwhile the second and third Pig were still on their way to the brickworks. When they passed a Man with a bundle of sticks, the second little Pig said to himself:

“Now I won’t need to walk so far to the brickworks! Sticks are stronger than straw – I think they’ll do the job, but anyway, I’m tired now. I’d much rather do less work and then spend the rest of my afternoon relaxing.”

So the first little pig said to the Man carrying the sticks:

“Please, Man, give me those sticks to build me a house.”

The Man did, and the little Pig quickly built a house with it right where he stood, and then settled down and prepared to have a sleep for the rest of the afternoon.

Then along came the Wolf and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”

“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

“Then I’ll puff and I’ll huff, and I’ll blow your house in!”

So he huffed and he puffed, and he puffed and he huffed, and at last he blew the house down, and ate up the second little Pig.

Finally the third little Pig reached the brickworks, where he met a Man with a load of bricks. He said:

“Please, Man, give me those bricks to build a house with.”

The Man kindly gave him the bricks, and he built his house with them a little way over, carefully, and taking the time to do it well.

So the Wolf came, as he did to the other little Pigs, and said, “Little Pig, little Pig, let me come in.”

“No, no, by the hair of my chinny chin chin.”

“Then I’ll huff and I’ll puff, and I’ll blow your house in.”
